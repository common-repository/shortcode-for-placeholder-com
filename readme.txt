Add a placeholder.com image anywhere you can use a shortcode.

== Description ==
This plugin is useful to quickly layout blog posts, create spacer images or anywhere you can run a short code and need image placeholder.

The shortcode looks like:

[ph_img w="100" h="100" bg="#000" c="#fff" t="my text" s="on"]

Required: w - the image width in pixels.
Required: h - the image height in pixels.
Optional: bg - the hex for the background color.
Optional: c - the hex for the text color.
Optional: t - text to write.
Optional: s - use https (any value).

If specifying the text color (c) you need to specify a background color (bg), and visa versa.
